# Recolored character's toolbar buttons
*A GUI mod for BG:EE and BG2:EE.*

**Author:**  Argent77

This mod provides recolored buttons for the toolbar displayed at the bottom of the screen to make the enabled/disabled states of the buttons more distinguishable.

Supports both Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.

**Note:** Installing the BG:EE components in Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear is not advisable as the color schemes have been optimized for the original GUI of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.

**Component for BG:EE**
You can choose between two color schemes:
- a more color-saturated version of the original
- a golden scheme that matches the colors of the icons of the left toolbar

**Component for BG2:EE**
Installs a bluish/violet color scheme.

Have fun!
