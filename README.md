*A GUI mod for BG:EE and BG2:EE.*

[![SHS Forums](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Discussion&message=SHS%20Forums&color=951514&labelColor=eee&style=flat)](http://www.shsforums.net/topic/57057-mod-recolored-toolbar-buttons-for-bgee-bg2ee/)

## Overview

This mod provides recolored buttons for the toolbar displayed at the bottom of the screen to make the enabled/disabled states of the buttons more distinguishable.

Supports both Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.

**Note:** Installing the BG:EE components in Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear is not advisable as the color schemes have been optimized for the original GUI of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.

**Component for BG:EE**
You can choose between two color schemes:
- a more color-saturated version of the original
- a golden scheme that matches the colors of the icons of the left toolbar

**Component for BG2:EE**
Installs a bluish/violet color scheme.

Have fun!
