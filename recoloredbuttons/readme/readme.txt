Overview
~~~~~~~~

This mod provides recolored buttons for the toolbar displayed at the bottom of the 
screen to make the enabled/disabled states of the buttons more distinguishable. 

Supports both Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.

Note: Installing the BG:EE components in Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear
      is not advisable as the color schemes have been optimized for the 
      original GUI of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.


Mod components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Component for BG:EE
You can choose between two color schemes: 
- a more color-saturated version of the original
- a golden scheme that matches the colors of the icons of the left toolbar

Component for BG2:EE
Installs a bluish/violet color scheme.

Have fun!
